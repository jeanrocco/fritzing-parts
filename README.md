Some special parts for my projects, these parts are good for breadboard and schematic only.

*  A strip board 3 joints grid 50 x 30 top <a href="https://github.com/jeanrocco/fritzing-parts/blob/master/Stripboard3jointgrid50x30top.pdf">view... </a> <a href="https://github.com/jeanrocco/fritzing-parts/blob/master/Stripboard3jointgrid50x30top.fzz">Download</a>
*  TPS27081 high side switch
*  STWD100 watchdog timer
*  MAX823T watchdog timer

Use these <a href="https://github.com/jeanrocco/fritzing-parts/blob/master/sot23-5_6.jpg">breakout</a> <a href="https://github.com/jeanrocco/fritzing-parts/blob/master/SOT-89.jpg">boards<a/> to solder the SMD <a href="https://github.com/jeanrocco/fritzing-parts/blob/master/SMD_chips.jpg">chips<a/> with low temperature solder <a href="https://github.com/jeanrocco/fritzing-parts/blob/master/SMD_solder_paste_low_temp.jpg">paste<a/>. 
You can get some at 15$, you don't need much. Try to spread thin amounts of paste on the board pads, place the chip as best as possible,
and shove everything in a toaster oven set to ~ 300F-400F.
It will take about 30 to 60 seconds for the paste to melt, watch it becoming a shinny liquid metal, and carefully take it out of the oven.
Solder bridges will often form, just spread the solder with a hot clean soldering iron making an outward sweeping motion on the pins/pads.
